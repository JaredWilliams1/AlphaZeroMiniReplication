# AlphaZeroMiniReplication
This is a project I made in freshman year that is meant to be an amateur recreation of DeepMind's AlphaZero algorithm applied to Connect4.

The concept is that it can learn games like chess, go, and connect4 from scratch purely by playing against itself.

I have worked on it some sophomore & junior year.

The proof of concept is there, it has been able to get to a skill level about that of your average person. The bottleneck from there was speed. I didn't have access to high performance computing and I certainly hadn't optimized it to a professional standard

At that point I just left it there, it was taking up too much time to develop and I needed to move on, it was an educational experience and I am only one person. An invaluable experience in reinforcement/supervised hybrid learning overall.

Since I know more now about parallel computing I may dust it off in the future and see if I can get it to beat the game of Connect4.
